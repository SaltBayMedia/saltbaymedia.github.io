We want _everyone_ to feel at home posting comments. We don’t know what your home is like, but we know how we expect people 
to behave when they visit ours. That’s why we reserve the right to delete comments and ban users as needed to keep the comment 
threads here civil and substantive.

Our No. 1 house rule is simple: **Don’t be a jerk**.

Here’s what we like to see in comments:

* **Weigh in with smart, informed ideas that contribute further to the story.**

* **Give us useful, constructive criticism.** Spot a typo or an error? Let us know and we will correct it.

* **Demonstrate and share the intelligence, wisdom, and humor we know you possess.**

* **Don’t feed the trolls**. Downvote and flag comments instead.

Although we can’t be everywhere at once, here are some of the kinds of comments we’re going to do our best to curtail:

* **Threats**. Play nice!

* **Racism, sexism, homophobia, you get the drift.** Don’t say we didn’t warn you.

* **Trolling.** If you’re out for a good trolling and are not contributing meaningfully to the conversation, we’ll be pushing you back under the bridge.

* **Comments that are completely out of left field.** Sometimes discussions veer off a bit, but are still related to the original
subject. That is fine. Hijacking the conversation to promote off-topic commentary is not.
